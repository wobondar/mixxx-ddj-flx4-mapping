# Pioneer DDJ-FLX4 (Custom) — Controller Reference

This file documents the current control layout and behavior of the custom Mixxx mapping for the Pioneer DDJ-FLX4.

It is intended as a practical reference for users and contributors.

---

## Scope

This mapping is not the stock Mixxx mapping. Several behaviors were intentionally changed to provide:

* more predictable transport behavior
* consistent LED feedback driven by engine state
* explicit loop workflows
* extended pad functionality
* improved behavior where Mixxx defaults are limited

Some functions are configurable in the script. Where relevant, this document notes that behavior may depend on script options.

---

# Global Notes

## Shift behavior

Each deck has its own Shift button. Shift modifies transport, loop, pad, browser, sync, and mixer behavior depending on the section.

## Vinyl mode

Vinyl mode is handled per deck and affects jog behavior.

Toggle:

* **Shift + 4BEAT/EXIT**

Vinyl mode is also inferred from controller MIDI state and not treated as a purely internal flag.

Depending on script configuration, Vinyl mode can optionally modify PLAY button behavior (brake / soft start).

## Sync behavior

This mapping follows Mixxx engine behavior:

* **Short press Sync** → one-shot beat alignment (`beatsync`)
* **Long press Sync** → persistent sync lock (`sync_enabled`)

This is not a Rekordbox-style Beat Sync mode.
Such a mode does not exist in Mixxx and cannot be emulated reliably.

# Browser / Library Section

## Browse encoder

### Rotate

* Scroll library vertically

### Press

* GoToItem (context-aware ENTER):

  * tree view, expandable node → toggle expansion
  * tree view, playlist/crate → jump into its track list
  * track table → track double-click action (no-op with preference "Ignore")

## Shift + Browse press

* Toggle pinned library tree mode (`[LibraryUI],tree_pinned`)

  Skin integration via the `[LibraryUI]` control convention (first
  implementer: the Daedalus skin), gated by `SKIN_TREE_INTEGRATION`.
  Pinned: tree always visible. Unpinned: tree only shows while it has
  library focus and auto-folds when focus moves to the track list.
  Harmless with non-implementing skins.

## Shift + Browse rotate

* Zoom waveform (both decks)

## Load buttons

### LOAD

* Load selected track
* Double press (timing-based):

  * Instant double from opposite deck

### Shift + LOAD

* Deck 1 → toggle library maximize
* Deck 2 → toggle focus between tree view and track table

  Script-controlled. With `BROWSE_FOCUS_TOGGLE_ONLY = false` it falls
  back to default Mixxx focus cycling instead.

---

# Transport Section

## Play / Pause

### Normal

* Play / Pause

### Optional Vinyl Brake Mode (script option)

If enabled:

* stopped deck → soft start
* playing deck → brake
* during brake → cancel and resume

## Shift + Play

* `reverseroll` (momentary slip reverse)

## Cue

### Normal

* `cue_default`

### Shift + Cue

* `start_stop`

---

# Sync / Tempo Section

## Sync

### Short press

* `beatsync`

### Long press

* `sync_enabled`

## Shift + Sync

* Cycle tempo range:

* ±8% → ±16% → ±32% → ±64% → ±100%

## Tempo fader

* 14-bit high-resolution mapping

---

# Jog Wheels

## Platter rotate

### Vinyl ON

* Scratch

### Vinyl OFF

* Pitch bend

## Platter touch

Scratch is enabled if:

* deck is stopped
* or Vinyl mode is active

Otherwise:

* bend mode

## Controller vinyl state

The script tracks the controller’s internal vinyl mode and uses it as input for scratch decisions.

## Shift + platter rotate

* Search directly through the track position

## Shift + platter touch

* Increase Shift + platter search speed while held

## Loop-adjust priority

When loop-adjust mode is active:

* jog controls loop point editing
* scratch/bend is suppressed

---

# Loop Section

## LOOP IN / LOOP OUT

Script-controlled behavior.

### `simple` mode

* direct loop in/out

### `workflow` mode

* guided loop creation
* pending loop-out state
* jog-based adjustment
* explicit state tracking

## 4BEAT/EXIT

* exit / re-enable loop
* fallback: create default loop

## Shift + 4BEAT/EXIT

* Toggle Vinyl mode

## Loop adjust

* Shift + LOOP IN / OUT → jog adjusts loop points

## CUE/LOOP CALL LEFT

### Normal

* halve loop or fallback reloop

### Shift

* quick jump backward

## CUE/LOOP CALL RIGHT

### Normal

* double loop or fallback reloop

### Shift

* quick jump forward

---

# Mixer Section

## EQ / Gain / Faders

### Gain
* standard high-resolution mapping

### Channel faders
* standard mapping

### EQ knobs
* 14-bit high-resolution mapping
* script-controlled routing

#### Normal
* control deck EQ:
  * **LOW** → EQ low
  * **MID** → EQ mid
  * **HIGH** → EQ high

#### Shift
* control stem volumes:
  * **LOW** → drums + bass stem volume
  * **MID** → melody / instruments stem volume
  * **HIGH** → vocals stem volume

#### Soft takeover
* separate soft takeover is used for:
  * EQ mode
  * stem mode
* pickup state is reset automatically when switching between EQ and stem mode
* this prevents abrupt jumps when returning from stem control to normal EQ operation

## Headphone Cue buttons

* toggle PFL

## Quantize / Keylock

Mapped to **Shift + Channel Cue buttons**

### Short press

* Quantize toggle

### Long press

* Keylock toggle

---

# Beat FX Section

## Preset requirement

Beat FX navigation uses fixed absolute preset positions. All supplied effect
chains named `01_` through `14_` must be installed without renaming or removing
individual presets. Additional chain presets must not change their sorted
positions. Otherwise the selected group or variant can point to a different
effect.

## FX SELECT

* Cycle FX groups
* Shift → cycle backward

## BEAT LEFT / RIGHT

* Cycle variants within current group

## ON/OFF

* toggle all slots
* partial state → reset

## Routing

* Unit1 → Deck1
* Unit2 → Deck2

## LEVEL/DEPTH

* 14-bit control

---

# Color FX / Smart CFX

## Smart CFX button

* Toggle QuickEffect

## Shift + Smart CFX

* Cycle QuickEffect preset

## Smart Fader button

### Tap

* Toggle slip mode on both decks

### Hold

* Enable slip mode on both decks while held
* Restore each deck's previous slip state on release

### Left Shift + tap

* Toggle keylock on Deck 1

### Right Shift + tap

* Toggle keylock on Deck 2

### Left Shift + hold

* Reset key on Deck 1

### Right Shift + hold

* Reset key on Deck 2

Both Shifts + press is reserved (no action). The Smart Fader button LED is
never driven: writing its address (0x96 0x01) arms the FLX4's onboard
smart-fader engine, which moves the mid EQs. Slip state is shown on screen.

## Filter knobs

* 14-bit control
* optional response shaping around center

# Contributor Notes

When changing behavior:

1. update XML
2. update script
3. update this file
4. document actual behavior only

Script overrides XML if conflicts exist.
