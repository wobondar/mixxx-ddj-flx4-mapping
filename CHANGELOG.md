# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- BROWSE press now triggers GoToItem (context-aware ENTER: expand/collapse
  tree nodes, open playlists, track double-click action in the track list)
- Shift + LOAD (Deck 2) now toggles library focus between tree view and
  track list (previously: MoveRight / open folder); honors
  `BROWSE_FOCUS_TOGGLE_ONLY`
- Shift + BROWSE press now toggles pinned library tree mode via the
  skin-agnostic `[LibraryUI]` control convention (`tree_pinned`; script
  computes `tree_visible` = pinned OR tree focused), gated by the new
  `SKIN_TREE_INTEGRATION` flag

### Added
- Smart Fader tap and hold gestures for slip, keylock, and key reset
- Shift-based stem volume control on EQ knobs
  - Shift + LOW controls drums + bass stem volume
  - Shift + MID controls melody / instruments stem volume
  - Shift + HIGH controls vocals stem volume
- `setup-mixxx-links.sh` for linking mapping assets into Mixxx user directories
- Support for linking assets into multiple Mixxx directories
- C_Noise sweep effect for Beat FX

### Changed
- EQ knobs are now routed through script handlers instead of direct XML EQ bindings
- EQ / stem handling now uses 14-bit script-side routing
- Scratch feel improved by increasing `scratchScale`
- Shift + jog search now uses the configurable `jogSearchScale` and `shiftSearchTouchMultiplier` values
- Removed obsolete seek-scratch configuration and unreachable seek-scratch state
- Setup and control documentation updated to reflect current EQ/stem and setup behavior

### Fixed
- Added required script binding for EQ script handlers
- Reset soft takeover state when switching between EQ and stem mode
- Stop and reset all mapping-owned timers during controller shutdown
- Restored loop adjust behavior in `jogTurn`
- Made vinyl mode deterministic and forced startup with vinyl off
- Setup script now handles directories correctly when linking Mixxx assets
- Prevented instant double from overwriting the playing deck
- Swapped Smart CFX normal and shift behavior to match intended workflow
- Made shift jog search controllable via playposition scaling
- Switched shift jog search to `playposition`-based behavior and bound shift touch correctly

### Documentation
- Updated README setup instructions
- Reformatted and reorganized the README
- Updated EQ/stem control documentation
- Documented setup script usage and current control behavior
